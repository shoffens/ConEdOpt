(a) For nitrogen blanket units, disconnect the end of the nitrogen system to                     avoid over-pressurization when adding oil.

The end of the tubing shall run                     back to ground level and into a containment vessel.     (2) Open valves, and observe the level of oil in Tygon tubing.  *In order to avoid introducing air bubbles into the compartment, clean hoses shall be charged and bled of air prior to adding oil into the compartment.  *Determine oil temperature using the oil temperature gauges on the transformer or other suitable method of determining oil temperature such as an infrared thermometer, or by scrolling thru the Kelman online DGA Monitor LCD.  * For nitrogen blanketed compartments, prior to pumping oil, open vent so the compartment is not overpressurized.  *Pump oil at a low flow rate of 5 GPM or less into compartments through the conservator oil fill valve or alternatively, the top fill valve until the oil level reaches the appropriate level based on the oil temperature.   *Verify the gauge is responding as the level is being adjusted and reading the appropriate level or make repairs as required.
