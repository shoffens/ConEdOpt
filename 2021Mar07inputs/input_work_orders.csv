(Only applies to circuit switchers with shunt trip mechanisms) When testing, it is not recommended that the Line Backer be closed into a made up trip circuit Define the perimeter of the maintenance area with barrier tape Check for availability of replacement parts Notify the S&TE Field Engineer at least 5 working days prior to the start of the inspection Record the following on the Data Sheet: Station name, equipment position, and date Maximo Work Order number Why the Circuit Switcher is being inspected All items are to be initialed by the mechanic who completed the task All discrepancies found must be recorded on the Data Sheet (EXHIBIT A SIEMENS TYPE CP “LINE BACKER” CIRCUIT SWITCHER INSPECTION REPORT) and reported to the supervisor for input into Maximo All measured data shall be recorded on the provided data sheets in EXHIBIT A SIEMENS TYPE CP “LINE BACKER” CIRCUIT SWITCHER INSPECTION REPORT Insure all data required is completed on the Data Splice Round and the Maintenance Instruction.
